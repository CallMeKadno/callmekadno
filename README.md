Kadx is the sub cli that can be used to execute the suite of Kadno developed software if you download it all as a 'bundle', such as launching Spectr, MASK, running an RTTP, etc. It 'soft locks' you into a sub cli so you can't run host system commands to ensure safe and proper utility. Kadx is required if you want to 'rice' your system based on the one Kadno uses!

# üîé <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+SPECTR" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Spectr is a web app that silos and consolidates data from across the globe which is open source accessable, and can be contributed to by the general public. Accessible feeds include traffic camera feeds, global Spectr anonymous reports (*pins on a map last for 60 minutes with a note similar to Waze*), and allows you to carry out mild open source intelligence investigations in a neat user interface such as whois and DNS lookups, network scans, etc. You can setup a Spectr instance on a remote server, or locally.

# üé≠ <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+MASK" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Mask is a mult-functional 'masking' program. Whether thats applying non-real-faces to your own live-camera in a form of live 'deep-fake' or generating realistic psudonames and psudo-identities for anonymity, even morphing your voice in real-time through the microphone. _Mask takes a great level of inspiration from the anime "Heroes Mask"_.

# üîí <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+QCRYPT" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Qcrypt is a PQC (*post quantum cryptography*) software intended to run along side LUKS, with Qcrypt you can encrypt and decrypt specific directories or individual files with Kyber-1024 and ECC for a 'dual-layer' approach. The keys can be kept remotely, or on a flash-drive too.

# ‚õìÔ∏è <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+QNET" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Qnet uses Qcrypt post quantum cryptography software where possible to establish a secure connection. Qnet can establish a proxy through proxychains (*must be configured independently*) or to a Qcrypt node (*see project for more information*), otherwise Qnet can be treated as a wrapper for third-party software that exists on the system such as proton-vpn. Qnet will install tor and enable/disable it on demand (*by default Qnet will enforce tor on boot ensuring a secured connection from the start*).

# ü™Ω <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+ICARUS" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Running Icarus (*one time*) deploys a system service that automates background processes using a localised, hand-crafted neural network. It analyses average patterns and trends over the last 74-hours across your CPU, GPU, RAM, and SWAP. Smartly killing services that are out of average patterns and exceed the 'safety' range. I.e; you launch a service you otherwise wouldn't, and it runs for over x-hours (*which you configure*) it will kill the service. It will not kill or modify default system services or ones added to an exclusion list such as `tor.service`.

# ‚è≥ <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+RTTP" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
RTTP (*return to the past*) has two functions. Primarily to act as a system amnesia agent, which removes bash_history, tmp, logs and records of the host system and interactions made on the system since your last boot. Essentially removing all evidence the system was interacted with. The secondary function of RTTP is to take your system back to your last RTTP backup (*you make a backup on the 1st of the month, and run RTTP recall on the 9th and it'll take you back to the system you had on the 1st*). This way RTTP acts as a reverse-tool of sorts.

# üêù <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+DRONESYNC" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
DroneSync is a powerful tool designed to streamline and automate code deployment processes across Linux systems. Like drone workers in a hive, each instance of DroneSync acts as an autonomous agent, when configuring as a server (*hive*) it'll pull code from a repository, running the scripts contained within, and ensuring synchronized deployments with minimal human intervention. Configuring as a client (*drone*) you can autonomously send code to another Linux system and it'll automate the deployment without further human intervention.

# üíø <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+OPTICS" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
Linux packet writing was depreciated years ago. Optics is a command line tool that lets you mount, read and write to DVD-/+RW, DVD-/+R, CD-RW, CD-R. After mounting the optical media it creates a 1:1 duplicate of it in the `tmp` directory for modifying. Once you have modified the duplicate it'll write back onto your optical media when you're ready. For CD-R it'll attempt to write it into a new track (*session*) and 'hide' the old files. </br></br> A CD-R can handle only handle a few 'sessions' with this method, it's not ideal for frequent or extensive file modifications. As such if you choose to you can take out the initial optical media once the `tmp` exists and put in a fresh *-/+RW and it will write the initial media duplicate onto your new disc for you. Giving you a way to migrate data too!

# üß¨ <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"> <img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+DNAR" alt="Typing SVG" /> </a>
DNAR allows you to scan raw genotype data, *such as that provided by 23andMe*. It iterates through a subset of markers that have been individually validated for accuracy, making it suitable for research, educational, and informational use.

For each SNP (*single nucleotide polymorphism*), DNAR collects:
- Identifier: rsID
- Genomic location: position on the human reference genome
- Genotype: the alleles oriented with respect to the plus strand

Using this information, DNAR can make educated analytical guesses about characteristics of the data owner.
Example: using DNAR you scan a raw genotype data file you've been given, `rs12913832` is located in the **HERC2** gene, which strongly influences **OCA2** expression. This SNP is a major determinant of eye color in Europeans. The alleles correspond approximately as follows:  

- AA: usually brown eyes  
- GG: usually blue eyes  
- AG: usually intermediate, often green, hazel, or light brown  

This individual‚Äôs genotype at `rs12913832` is `AG`, DNAR would infer that the person likely has *green, hazel, or light brown eyes*, given it is often for hazel and light-brown statistically this rules out the likelyhood of them being a blue eye variant, and statistically low for green eyes.

# ü™™ <a href="https://git.io/typing-svg"><img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Orbitron&pause=1000&color=DCDCDC&vCenter=true&width=435&height=20&lines=%3E_++RUN+IDR" alt="Typing SVG" /></a>
IDR is a sophisticated identification and profiling tool designed to collect, validate, and analyse a wide range of personal, vehicle, corporate, and geospatial information. It is built for research, security analysis, and educational purposes, providing actionable insights while maintaining ethical standards - currently under active development. Key features including:

- Banking and Financial Verification: validate IBANs and banking codes to identify registered bank account location. Know if someones account ties to say, London, and what branch location.
- Vehicle and License Plate Recognition: known as an LPR it can recognise full and patial license plates in a variety of countries and retrieve detailed vehicle data, including tax status, manufacturer specifications, and mechanics records particularly from a UK and EU M.O.T.
- Phone line intelligence: validating phone numbers determining line types (*mobile, landline, VoIP, toll-free*), detecting country and carrier. Attempting identity matches.
- Email analysis: analysing email headers to infer origin IP, city and ISP.
- Social profiling: collects public profile information and correlate identities across accounts. Infering connections too based on localised smart neural analysis uncovering if `Adam Smith` on Meta and `ASmitty` on Twitter are the same individual by comparing key profile details, stylometry, and keystroke dynamics among other factors.
- Corporate records: retrieve company information, including directors, secretary, and key personnel.
- Land records: analyse land and property records to assess ownership, location-based risks, and patterns. Including multi-modal routing networks, topography layers, boundary lines, and geospatial information.
- Orbital imagery: Access recent satellite imagery across a range of spectrum this can be 'targetted' to specific post and zip codes, or coordinates. Generating visual near real-time insigns for specific interest or nearest-time images in basic spectrums.
- Profiler: Built in 'profiler', allowing you to create Qcrypt secured profiles utilising OSINT data or view historic profiles. Profiles can be previewed in clean PDF format, terminal style, _or should an image of the individual be in the database then basic-data overlayed onto the image_. Consolidating all available local data.
